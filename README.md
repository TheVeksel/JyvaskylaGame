# Jyv√§skyl√§ Game

This educational game was developed during my internship at **Mosaiikki Ry** for their children‚Äôs educational games website. 

## Project Concept
The game aims to combine learning with fun:  
1. Players first learn interesting facts about the city of Jyv√§skyl√§.  
2. They then take a simple quiz based on the learned facts.  

Despite the simplicity of the concept, the final result turned out to be highly engaging and effective.

## Features
- **Multilingual Support**: The game is available in **four languages**, allowing players to learn new words in a foreign language.  
  - This is particularly helpful for children from other countries who have moved to Finland, as they can expand their vocabulary with words related to the city they now live in.  
- Interactive and educational gameplay to keep users engaged while learning.

## Current Status
The game is currently hosted on Vercel:  
üëâ [Jyv√§skyl√§ Game](https://jyvaskyla-game.vercel.app/)  

It will soon be migrated to the **Mosaiikki Ry** website.
